        <p> This is a no hassle, no bake recipe that's easy to make and a swiss army knife of a snack/breakfast</p>
        <p> It's delicious, nutritious, and the ideal meal right down to the last bite!</p>
        <h3> Here is what you'll need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Berries: Strawberries, Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries.</li>
            <li> Yogurt. Preferably Greek. Health probiotics are always a nice add!</li>
            <li> Granola or oats. Quick oats work better to soften in the fridge, but Granola is sweeter</li>
            <li> Honey. A honey from your local apiary adds a nice touch.</li>
            <li> A wide bottomed cup or glass. A small glass bowl can work as well</li>

            <li> Drizzle some honey across the oats/granola and berry mixture on the yogurt</li>
            <li> Add another quarter of yogurt on top of the mixture</li>
            <li> Sprinkle more berries and oats/granola</li>
            <li> Drizzle more honey on top</li>
            <li> let the mixture sit in the fridge over night to solidify up the recipe</li>
